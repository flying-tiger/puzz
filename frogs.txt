# Problem Statement:
#  - Each row represents a tile
#  - Each digraph in a row represents an edge of the tile
#  - Edges are listed clockwise from the top (top, right, bottom, left)
#  - First letter in the digraph is edge color (Red, Green, Blue, Yellow)
#  - Second letter in the digraph is edge "direction" (Head, Tail)
#  - Edges "match" when a Tail abuts a Head of the same color.
#  - The solution is a 3-by-3 tile arangement with all edges matched.
